# CONTEXT: LLM Arena Logger

## 1. Current Project Status

The "LLM Arena Logger" project is in the __initial setup phase, with basic backend and frontend directory structures established__. Product requirements are documented in `PRD.md`. The high-level implementation plan remains relevant.

## 2. Brief History

The project was initiated to create a web application, "LLM Arena Logger," for recording, viewing, filtering, and analyzing interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). The backend uses Python Flask, the frontend uses React, and data is stored in an SQLite database.

## 3. Detailed Recent Task Context (as of 2025-05-07)

- __Product Requirements Definition (`PRD.md`)__:
  - Detailed application requirements (data structures, UI/UX, features, tech stack) are in `PRD.md`.

- __Project Skeleton Setup__:
  - **Backend (Flask)**:
    - Created directory structure:
      - `backend/app/models/` (with `.gitkeep`)
      - `backend/app/routes/` (with `.gitkeep`)
      - `backend/app/services/` (with `.gitkeep`)
      - `backend/app/utils/` (with `.gitkeep`)
    - Created initial files:
      - `backend/config.py` (basic configuration placeholders)
      - `backend/requirements.txt` (listed core Python dependencies: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Pillow, pandas)
    - Guided the creation and reviewed:
      - `backend/run.py` (Flask app runner script)
      - `backend/app/__init__.py` (Flask app factory `create_app` function with basic configuration loading)
  - **Frontend (React)**:
    - Created directory structure:
      - `frontend/src/components/` (with `.gitkeep`)
      - `frontend/src/pages/` (with `.gitkeep`)
      - `frontend/src/services/` (with `.gitkeep`)
      - `frontend/src/utils/` (with `.gitkeep`)
    - Created placeholder files (currently empty or minimal, to be properly initialized next):
      - `frontend/package.json`
      - `frontend/index.html`

- __Initial Implementation Plan (Still Valid)__:

  - __Project Structure (as implemented for skeleton)__:

    ```
  - __Development Phases__:
    1.  Backend Development (setup, models, APIs, file upload, analytics, tests)
    2.  Frontend Development (setup, UI components, API integration, responsive design, tests)
    3.  Integration and Optimization (testing, performance, UX improvements, deployment prep)
  - __Proposed Technology Stack__:
    - __Backend__: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Pillow, pandas.
    - __Frontend__: React 18, React Router, Axios, Material-UI, React Query, Recharts, React Hook Form, Jest & React Testing Library.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Initialize Frontend Project**: Use a build tool (e.g., Vite) to properly initialize the React project within the `frontend` directory. This will generate a functional `package.json`, `index.html`, and basic application structure with necessary development dependencies and scripts.
2.  **Backend**: Begin defining database models in `backend/app/models/` and setting up SQLAlchemy.
3.  **Frontend**: Start creating basic UI components and page layouts based on `PRD.md`.

## 5. Collaboration Notes & Guidelines

-   **Your Role (User/Partner)**: You are taking on the role of a **junior developer** for this project. You will be actively involved in writing code and making decisions, with guidance.
-   **My Role (Cline)**: I will act as a **senior full-stack engineer and mentor**.
    -   My primary approach is to **guide you** through tasks, explain concepts, suggest solutions, provide pseudocode or examples, and help diagnose issues.
    -   I will **avoid writing full code implementations directly** unless explicitly asked or if it's for a very minor, non-critical part. The goal is for you to learn and build the application.
    -   When you complete a piece of work or have questions, I will **review your code** and provide feedback.
    -   If instructions or questions are unclear, I will ask for clarification.
    -   We will aim to follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where appropriate, starting with unit tests.
