# CONTEXT: LLM Prompt Logger

## 1. Current Project Status

The "LLM Prompt Logger" project has its basic backend and frontend directory structures established. The frontend React project has been initialized using Vite, core dependencies installed, and basic page routing set up. Product requirements are documented in `PRD.md`.

## 2. Brief History

The project was initiated to create a web application, "LLM Prompt Logger," for recording, viewing, filtering, and analyzing interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). The backend uses Python Flask, the frontend uses React, and data is stored in an SQLite database. Initial skeleton structures for both backend and frontend were created.

## 3. Detailed Recent Task Context (as of 2025-05-12)

- __Product Requirements Definition (`PRD.md`)__:
  - Detailed application requirements (data structures, UI/UX, features, tech stack) remain in `PRD.md`.

- __Project Skeleton Setup (Previous Session)__:
  - Established basic directory structures for Flask backend and React frontend.
  - Created initial backend files (`config.py`, `requirements.txt`, `run.py`, `app/__init__.py`).
  - Created placeholder frontend files (`package.json`, `index.html`, empty `src` structure).

- __Frontend Initialization & Basic Setup (Current Session - 2025-05-12)__:
  - **Vite Initialization**: Guided user to initialize the React project in the `frontend` directory using `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react`. Confirmed successful setup by reviewing `package.json` and `src/main.jsx`.
  - **Dependency Installation**: Guided user to install core frontend dependencies via `npm install react-router-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled axios`. Confirmed update in `package.json`.
  - **Page Component Placeholders**: Guided user to create basic functional components for main pages in `frontend/src/pages/`:
    - `HomePage.jsx`
    - `NewRecordPage.jsx`
    - `MetadataPage.jsx`
    - `AnalyticsPage.jsx`
  - **Navigation Component**: Guided user to create and populate `frontend/src/components/NavBar.jsx` using Material-UI (`AppBar`, `Toolbar`, `Button`, etc.) and React Router `Link` for navigation.
  - **Routing Setup**: Guided user to update `frontend/src/App.jsx` to:
    - Use `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route` from `react-router-dom`.
    - Integrate `NavBar`.
    - Use MUI `CssBaseline` and `Container`.
    - Define routes linking paths (`/`, `/new`, `/metadata`, `/analytics`) to the corresponding page components.
  - **Troubleshooting**: Resolved an initial startup error (`Could not resolve: index.css`) by removing a redundant import from `App.jsx`.

- __Current Known Issues__:
  - **Layout Problem**: After successfully starting the dev server (`npm run dev`), the application content renders only in the middle-left portion of the screen. This needs investigation and fixing in the next session.

## 4. Next Steps (Tentative)

1.  **Frontend**:
    *   **Fix Layout Issue**: Investigate and resolve the CSS/layout problem causing content to render incorrectly. Check `index.css`, `App.css` (if present), MUI `Container` behavior, and potential conflicts.
    *   **Refine Basic Layout**: Ensure the `Container` and general page structure behave as expected for a full-width or centered layout.
    *   Start implementing the UI for one of the pages (e.g., `HomePage` or `MetadataPage`) based on `PRD.md`, using Material-UI components.
    *   Begin writing basic unit tests for components (following TDD).
2.  **Backend**:
    *   Begin defining database models in `backend/app/models/` using SQLAlchemy based on `PRD.md` Section I.
    *   Set up Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate in `backend/app/__init__.py`.

## 5. Collaboration Notes & Guidelines

-   **Your Role (User/Partner)**: You are taking on the role of a **junior developer** for this project. You will be actively involved in writing code and making decisions, with guidance.
-   **My Role (Cline)**: I will act as a **senior full-stack engineer and mentor**.
    -   My primary approach is to **guide you** through tasks, explain concepts, suggest solutions, provide pseudocode or examples, and help diagnose issues.
    -   I will **avoid writing full code implementations directly** unless explicitly asked or if it's for a very minor, non-critical part. The goal is for you to learn and build the application.
    -   When you complete a piece of work or have questions, I will **review your code** and provide feedback.
    -   If instructions or questions are unclear, I will ask for clarification.
    -   We will aim to follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where appropriate, starting with unit tests.
